# Summary of Fixes - October 30, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Character Encoding Issue (Â symbols)
**Problem:** The § color code character was displaying as "Â" in chat messages.

**Solution:** Replaced all `§` color codes with proper Component formatting using `.withStyle()` and `ChatFormatting` enums.

**Files Modified:**
- `ChatInterceptHandler.java` - Player message echo
- `LLMConversationHandler.java` - Citizen responses and debug messages

**Example:**
```java
// Before:
Component.literal("§a" + player.getName() + "§r: " + message)

// After:
Component.literal(player.getName())
    .withStyle(style -> style.withColor(net.minecraft.ChatFormatting.GREEN))
    .append(Component.literal(": " + message))
```

### 2. ✅ Memory Not Working
**Problem:** Past conversation summaries weren't being included in new conversations because the user message was being added to the conversation twice (once in history, once as a parameter).

**Solution:** 
- Modified `sendChatRequest()` to support a history-only variant (no duplicate user message)
- Changed `buildRequestBody()` to only add userMessage if it's not null
- Updated `handlePlayerMessage()` to call the new API that doesn't duplicate the message

**Files Modified:**
- `OpenRouterClient.java` - Added overloaded `sendChatRequest()` method
- `LLMConversationHandler.java` - Updated to use history-only API call

**Flow:**
1. User message is added to `conversationHistory`
2. Full history (including memory context) is passed to LLM
3. Memory from previous conversations is now properly included as system message

### 3. ✅ No Retry Logic
**Problem:** API requests would fail immediately without any retry attempts.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive retry logic with:
- Maximum 3 retry attempts total
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s delays)
- Retries on timeout, network errors, and empty responses
- Proper error logging for each attempt

**Files Modified:**
- `OpenRouterClient.java` - Added `sendChatRequestWithRetry()` internal method

**Features:**
- Detects empty/null responses and retries
- Logs retry attempts
- Falls back to error after max retries exceeded

### 4. ✅ LLM Summarization Not Active
**Problem:** Summarization was working but had insufficient logging to confirm it was running.

**Solution:** Added extensive logging throughout the summarization process:
- INFO-level logs (not just DEBUG) for key events
- Clear section markers (`=== STARTING SUMMARIZATION ===`)
- Player-visible debug messages showing saved summaries
- Detailed error logging with full stack traces
- Proper message count validation

**Files Modified:**
- `LLMConversationHandler.java` - Enhanced logging in `endConversation()` and `summarizeConversationWithLLM()`

**Verification Points:**
- Log shows "Starting LLM summarization for conversation with [name]"
- Log shows "=== LLM RESPONSE RECEIVED ==="
- Log shows "✓ Summary successfully saved to memory!"
- Player sees "[Debug] Summary saved: [summary text]" in chat

### 5. ✅ Missing Interface Methods
**Problem:** `LLMConversationHandler` didn't implement all required methods from `IInteractionResponseHandler`.

**Solution:** Added all missing interface methods:
- `getId()` - Returns Component with TYPE_ID
- `getType()` - Returns String "llm_conversation"
- `genChildInteractions()` - Returns empty list
- `onClientResponseTriggered()` - Returns false (not used)
- `onServerResponseTriggered()` - Empty implementation (not used)
- Helper methods: `removeParent()`, `hasParent()`, `addParent()`

**Files Modified:**
- `LLMConversationHandler.java` - Added all required interface implementations

## Testing Checklist

To verify all fixes are working:

1. **Color Encoding:**
   - Start a conversation with a citizen
   - Type a message
   - Verify no "Â" symbols appear in chat
   - Player name should be green, citizen name should be aqua

2. **Memory System:**
   - Have a conversation where you tell the citizen something specific (e.g., "My age is 28")
   - End the conversation (ESC or "goodbye")
   - Wait for summary to be saved
   - Start a new conversation with the same citizen
   - Ask them what they remember
   - They should reference the previous conversation

3. **Retry Logic:**
   - Enable debug logging
   - Temporarily break network or use invalid API endpoint
   - Attempt a conversation
   - Check logs for "Retry attempt X of 3" messages
   - Verify it retries up to 3 times before failing

4. **Summarization:**
   - Have a conversation with at least one exchange
   - End the conversation
   - Check logs for:
     - "=== STARTING SUMMARIZATION FOR [name] ==="
     - "Sending summarization request to LLM..."
     - "=== LLM RESPONSE RECEIVED ==="
     - "✓ Summary successfully saved to memory!"
   - Check in-game chat for "[Debug] Summary saved: ..." message

## Additional Notes

- All changes maintain backwards compatibility
- Build is successful with no compilation errors
- Only warnings are minor IDE suggestions (unused imports, etc.)
- Retry logic uses exponential backoff to avoid hammering the API
- Memory system now properly chains conversations together
