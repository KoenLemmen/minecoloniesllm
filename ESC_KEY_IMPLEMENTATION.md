# ESC Key Handling Implementation

## Summary
Implemented proper ESC key handling so that when a player is in a conversation with a citizen, pressing ESC will cancel the conversation instead of opening the Minecraft pause menu.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created

1. **EscapeKeyHandler.java**
   - Listens to `ScreenEvent.Opening` events
   - Detects when PauseScreen is about to open
   - If player is in conversation:
     - Cancels the conversation (client-side state)
     - Sends EndConversationPacket to server
     - Cancels the screen opening event (prevents pause menu)

2. **ClientConversationState.java**
   - Client-side conversation state tracker
   - Tracks which citizen the player is currently talking to
   - Methods:
     - `setConversationPartner(Integer citizenId)` - Set active conversation
     - `getConversationPartner()` - Get current conversation citizen ID
     - `isInConversation()` - Check if in conversation
     - `clearConversation()` - Clear conversation state

3. **SyncConversationStatePacket.java**
   - Server-to-client packet for syncing conversation state
   - Sent when conversation starts or ends
   - Updates ClientConversationState on the client

### Modified Files

1. **KeyBindings.java**
   - Removed the `cancelConversationKey` keybinding (no longer needed)
   - Cleaned up unused imports

2. **KeyInputHandler.java**
   - Removed cancel conversation key handling
   - Removed `handleCancelConversation()` method
   - Cleaned up unused imports

3. **LLMConversationsMod.java**
   - Added registration for `SyncConversationStatePacket`
   - Packet is registered as `playToClient` (server to client)

4. **StartConversationPacket.java**
   - Added sending of `SyncConversationStatePacket` when conversation starts
   - Notifies client to enter conversation state

5. **EndConversationPacket.java**
   - Added sending of `SyncConversationStatePacket` when conversation ends
   - Notifies client to clear conversation state

6. **ChatInterceptHandler.java**
   - Added `SyncConversationStatePacket` in `endConversation()` method
   - Ensures client state is synced when conversation ends via chat

7. **LLMConversationHandler.java**
   - Added `SyncConversationStatePacket` in `endConversation()` method
   - Ensures client state is synced when conversation ends normally

## Behavior

### Before Changes
- ESC key would open pause menu even during conversation
- Player had to use the cancel key binding to exit conversation
- Confusing UX as pause menu appeared while still in conversation

### After Changes
- When NOT in conversation: ESC opens pause menu (default behavior)
- When IN conversation: ESC cancels the conversation and does NOT open pause menu
- Clear and intuitive UX - ESC exits the current context

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. Server tracks conversation state in `ConversationStateManager`
2. When conversation starts, server sends `SyncConversationStatePacket(citizenId, true)` to client
3. Client stores conversation state in `ClientConversationState`
4. When ESC is pressed, `EscapeKeyHandler` intercepts the `ScreenEvent.Opening` event
5. If in conversation, it:
   - Clears client-side state immediately
   - Sends `EndConversationPacket` to server
   - Cancels the screen opening event
6. Server processes end conversation and confirms with `SyncConversationStatePacket(citizenId, false)`

### Why This Approach
- Uses Forge's event system properly
- `ScreenEvent.Opening` is cancellable (unlike `InputEvent.Key`)
- Client-side state prevents any flicker or delay
- Server remains authoritative for actual conversation state
- Clean separation of concerns

## Testing
- Build successful with no compilation errors
- All packet handlers registered correctly
- Client-side state management implemented
- Server-side sync implemented at all conversation end points
