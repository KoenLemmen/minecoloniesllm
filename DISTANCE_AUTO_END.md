# Distance-Based Auto-End Conversation Feature

## Overview

Conversations now automatically end if the player walks too far away from the citizen. This prevents citizens from being stuck in "conversation mode" if the player walks away without properly ending the conversation.

---

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### What Was Added

1. **Configuration Option** - `maxConversationDistance` in `LLMConfig.java`
2. **Distance Checking** - Added to `maintainLookAtPlayer()` method
3. **Auto-End Logic** - Two new methods for handling distance/player-gone scenarios
4. **Localization** - Translation keys added to `en_us.json`

---

## 📋 Configuration

### Config File Location
`config/llmconversations-client.toml`

### New Setting
```toml
[conversation_control]
    # Maximum distance in blocks before a conversation automatically ends
    # Set to 0 to disable distance checking
    # Range: 0.0 ~ 50.0
    max_conversation_distance = 10.0
```

### Default Values
- **Default**: 10.0 blocks
- **Minimum**: 0.0 (disabled)
- **Maximum**: 50.0 blocks

### Usage
- Set to **0** to disable distance checking entirely
- Set to **10** for normal conversations (default)
- Set to **5** for close-range only
- Set to **20+** for long-distance conversations

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Distance Checking Flow

```
Every tick (via StatMaintenanceHandler):
  maintainFrozenStats(citizen) called
    ↓
  maintainLookAtPlayer(citizen) called
    ↓
  Check if player exists:
    ↓ YES
    Check distance:
      ↓ > maxDistance
      endConversationDueToDistance(citizen, player)
        - Send "too far" message to player
        - End conversation properly (saves summary via LLM)
        - Unfreeze stats
        - Reset AI
      ↓ ≤ maxDistance
      Continue conversation
        - Stop navigation
        - Update look direction
    ↓ NO (player logged out/dimension change)
    endConversationDueToPlayerGone(citizen)
      - Silent cleanup
      - Unfreeze stats
      - Reset AI
      - No message (player is gone)
```

### Technical Details

#### Distance Calculation
```java
double distance = citizen.distanceTo(player);
double maxDistance = LLMConfig.CLIENT.maxConversationDistance.get();

if (maxDistance > 0 && distance > maxDistance) {
    endConversationDueToDistance(citizenData, player);
}
```

- Uses Minecraft's `Entity.distanceTo()` method
- 3D distance calculation (includes vertical distance)
- Checked every 20 ticks (1 second)

#### Player Existence Check
```java
ServerPlayer player = citizen.getServer()
    .getPlayerList()
    .getPlayer(playerUUID);

if (player != null) {
    // Check distance
} else {
    // Player gone - silent cleanup
    endConversationDueToPlayerGone(citizenData);
}
```

## 📝 Code Changes

### 1. LLMConfig.java

**Added field:**
```java
public final ModConfigSpec.DoubleValue maxConversationDistance;
```

**Added configuration:**
```java
maxConversationDistance = builder
    .comment("Maximum distance in blocks before a conversation automatically ends",
             "Set to 0 to disable distance checking")
    .translation("llmconversations.config.max_conversation_distance")
    .defineInRange("max_conversation_distance", 10.0, 0.0, 50.0);
```

### 2. ConversationStateManager.java

**Modified `maintainLookAtPlayer()` method:**
- Added distance checking logic
- Added player existence check
- Calls appropriate end method based on scenario

**Added `endConversationDueToDistance()` method:**
- Sends message to player
- Properly ends conversation through handler
- Saves conversation summary via LLM
- Unfreezes stats and resets AI
- Syncs state to client

**Added `endConversationDueToPlayerGone()` method:**
- Silent cleanup (no message)
- Unfreezes stats and resets AI
- Handles case where player doesn't exist

### 3. en_us.json

**Added translation key:**
```json
"llmconversations.message.too_far": "You walked too far from %s. Conversation ended."
```

**Added config translations:**
```json
"llmconversations.config.max_conversation_distance": "Max Conversation Distance",
"llmconversations.config.max_conversation_distance.tooltip": "Maximum distance in blocks before a conversation automatically ends (set to 0 to disable)"
```

## 🎯 End Conversation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Player Walks Too Far
```
Player starts conversation with citizen
  ↓
Player walks 11 blocks away (maxDistance = 10)
  ↓
Distance check triggers
  ↓
Player receives message: "You walked too far from [Citizen Name]. Conversation ended."
  ↓
Conversation ends properly:
  - LLM generates summary (async)
  - Stats unfrozen
  - AI reset
  - Citizen returns to work
```

### Scenario 2: Player Logs Out
```
Player starts conversation with citizen
  ↓
Player disconnects/logs out
  ↓
Player existence check fails
  ↓
Silent cleanup:
  - No message (player is gone)
  - Stats unfrozen
  - AI reset
  - Citizen returns to work
  - No LLM summary (conversation incomplete)
```

### Scenario 3: Player Changes Dimension
```
Player starts conversation with citizen
  ↓
Player goes through nether portal
  ↓
Player existence check fails (different dimension)
  ↓
Silent cleanup:
  - Stats unfrozen
  - AI reset
  - Citizen returns to work
```

### Scenario 4: Distance Check Disabled
```
maxConversationDistance = 0.0
  ↓
Distance checking skipped
  ↓
Player can walk any distance
  ↓
Conversation continues until manually ended
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Distance Testing
- [ ] Start conversation with default config (10 blocks)
- [ ] Walk exactly 10 blocks away
- [ ] Verify conversation continues (≤ max)
- [ ] Walk 11 blocks away
- [ ] Verify conversation ends with message
- [ ] Verify citizen returns to work

### Config Testing
- [ ] Set distance to 5 blocks
- [ ] Verify conversation ends at 6 blocks
- [ ] Set distance to 0 (disabled)
- [ ] Walk 50+ blocks away
- [ ] Verify conversation continues
- [ ] Set distance to 50 blocks
- [ ] Walk 40 blocks away
- [ ] Verify conversation continues

### Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Start conversation
- [ ] Log out immediately
- [ ] Log back in
- [ ] Verify citizen is working normally (not stuck)
- [ ] Start conversation
- [ ] Go through nether portal
- [ ] Return to overworld
- [ ] Verify no conversation state lingering
- [ ] Start conversation while walking
- [ ] Walk away during initial greeting
- [ ] Verify auto-end works immediately

### Multiple Conversation Testing
- [ ] Start conversations with 3 different citizens
- [ ] Walk away from one
- [ ] Verify only that conversation ends
- [ ] Verify other 2 continue
- [ ] Walk away from all
- [ ] Verify all end individually

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Computational Cost
- **Per tick overhead**: 1 distance calculation per conversation
- **Distance calculation**: O(1) - simple 3D distance formula
- **Only runs**: For citizens actively in conversation
- **Frequency**: Every 20 ticks (1 second) via StatMaintenanceHandler

### Memory Impact
- **No new data structures**: Uses existing maps
- **No additional storage**: Just reads config value

### Network Impact
- **End message**: 1 packet when distance exceeded
- **Sync packet**: 1 packet to sync conversation state
- **Total**: 2 packets per auto-end event

## 🎨 User Experience

### Player Perspective

**Before this feature:**
- Player walks away
- Citizen stuck looking at empty space
- Stats frozen indefinitely
- Must remember to type "goodbye" from far away
- Awkward experience

**After this feature:**
- Player walks away
- System detects distance
- Automatic graceful end
- Clear message explaining why
- Natural experience

### Message Examples

**English:**
```
You walked too far from Alice. Conversation ended.
```

**Formatted in-game:**
```
[System] You walked too far from Alice. Conversation ended.
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements

1. **Warning System**
   - Send warning at 80% of max distance
   - "You're walking away from [Citizen]. Say goodbye to end conversation."

2. **Gradual Distance Increase**
   - Start at 5 blocks
   - Increase to 10 blocks after 30 seconds
   - Allows player to reposition without ending

3. **Follow Mode**
   - Config option: `allow_citizen_follow`
   - Citizen walks with player if distance > threshold
   - Conversation continues while moving

4. **Distance-Based Look Decay**
   - At close range: Citizen always looks at player
   - At medium range: Occasional look away (natural)
   - At far range: Warning before auto-end

5. **2D vs 3D Distance**
   - Config option: `use_horizontal_distance_only`
   - Ignores vertical distance (Y-axis)
   - Better for multi-floor buildings

### Implementation Notes
Would require:
- Additional config options
- More complex state management
- Pathfinding integration (for follow mode)
- Timer/delay system (for warnings)
