# Memory System Fix

## Problem
The conversation memory system was saving summaries of past conversations, but these memories were not being properly utilized in subsequent conversations. The NPC couldn't remember information shared in previous conversations (e.g., the player's age).

## Root Causes (Two Issues Found!)

### Issue 1: Memories in Conversation History (Not System Prompt)
Memories were being loaded in the `LLMConversationHandler` constructor and added to the **conversation history** as system messages. This approach had several issues:
1. System messages in conversation history are not as effective as including context in the system prompt
2. The memory context could be lost or diluted when conversation history was trimmed
3. The LLM wasn't explicitly instructed to use these memories for continuity

### Issue 2: No Actual Persistence! (The Real Problem)
The `ConversationMemory.get()` and `save()` methods were **stub implementations**! They had TODO comments saying "memory is runtime-only" but they weren't even persisting during runtime:
- `get()` always created a new empty `ConversationMemory` object
- `save()` did absolutely nothing
- Result: Memories were "saved" but immediately lost on the next `get()` call

## Solution
**Two-part fix: Implement actual persistence + Move memories to system prompt:**

### Part 1: Implement Real Memory Persistence

1. **Modified `ConversationMemory.java`:**
   - Added `MEMORY_CACHE` - a HashMap that stores memories per citizen ID
   - Implemented `get()` to retrieve from cache or create new memory
   - Implemented `save()` to actually store memory in the cache
   - Added debug logging to track memory operations
   - Memories now persist during game session (lost on server restart, but that's OK for now)

### Part 2: Move Memories to System Prompt

2. **Modified `PromptBuilder.java`:**
   - Added `buildMemoryContext()` method that retrieves past conversation summaries
   - Integrated memory context directly into the system prompt generation
   - Added explicit instructions for the LLM to use memories for continuity
   - Memories are now presented as "Your memories of past conversations with [Player]:"

3. **Modified `LLMConversationHandler.java`:**
   - Removed memory loading from the constructor
   - Memories are now loaded fresh each time via the system prompt (more reliable)
   - Added comment explaining the architectural change

## How It Works Now

### Memory Flow:
1. **During Conversation:** Normal chat messages are exchanged
2. **When Conversation Ends:** LLM creates a concise summary (10-20 words)
3. **Summary Saved:** Summary is stored in the citizen's ConversationMemory
4. **Next Conversation:** When system prompt is built, memories are retrieved and included

### System Prompt Structure:
```
[Base citizen information: name, job, colony, happiness, etc.]

Your memories of past conversations with [Player]:
- [Memory 1]
- [Memory 2]
- [Memory 3]
...

Use these memories to maintain continuity in your conversation.
If the player asks you something you should know from a previous conversation, refer to your memories.

[Recent colony events...]
```

## Benefits
- **Better Context Awareness:** Memories are in the system prompt where they have maximum influence
- **Explicit Instructions:** LLM is told to use memories for continuity
- **More Reliable:** Memories are loaded fresh each conversation, not stored in history
- **Natural Conversations:** NPCs can now reference past conversations naturally

## Example
**First Conversation:**
- Player: "My age is 28!"
- NPC: "Whoa, 28! I'm still figuring things out here..."
- **Memory Saved:** "User disclosed they are 28 years old; assistant responded with informal chat about settlement life."

**Second Conversation:**
- System prompt includes: "Your memories of past conversations with TheRealLemon: - User disclosed they are 28 years old..."
- Player: "What's my age again?"
- NPC: "You mentioned you're 28 years old!" âœ“

## Files Changed
1. `ConversationMemory.java` - **CRITICAL FIX:** Implemented actual persistence using HashMap cache
2. `PromptBuilder.java` - Added memory context to system prompt with explicit instructions
3. `LLMConversationHandler.java` - Removed memory from conversation history

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Start a conversation with a citizen
2. Share some information (e.g., "I'm 28 years old")
3. End the conversation
4. Start a new conversation with the same citizen
5. Ask about the information you shared
6. The citizen should now remember!
