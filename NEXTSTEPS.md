## üìã Next Steps to Build and Test

### 1. Download Gradle Wrapper (if needed)

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:\Users\koenl\Documents\Minecolonies idea\minecoloniesllm"

# If you don't have Gradle installed, download the wrapper:
# Visit https://gradle.org/install/ and follow Windows instructions
# Or download from https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip
```

### 2. Build the Project

```powershell
# First time setup - this will download dependencies
.\gradlew build

# If you encounter errors:
# - Check that JDK 21 is installed
# - Verify internet connection (downloads dependencies)
# - Check Minecolonies version availability on maven.ldtteam.com
```

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

```powershell
# Generate IDE project files

# For IntelliJ IDEA:
.\gradlew genIntellijRuns

# For Eclipse:
.\gradlew genEclipseRuns

# For VS Code:
# Just open the folder, Java extension should detect it
```

### 4. Test in Development

```powershell
# Run Minecraft client with the mod
.\gradlew runClient

# Run dedicated server
.\gradlew runServer
```

### 5. First Test Checklist

When Minecraft launches with the mod:

- [ ] Check logs for "Initializing LLM Conversations" message
- [ ] Verify config file generated at `run/config/llm-conversations-client.toml`
- [ ] Add your OpenRouter API key to the config
- [ ] Restart and load a world with Minecolonies
- [ ] Shift+right-click a citizen
- [ ] Type a message and wait for AI response
- [ ] Type "goodbye" to end conversation
- [ ] Check that citizen stats don't decrease during chat
- [ ] Verify conversation saves/loads properly

## üêõ Expected Issues and Fixes

### Issue: "Package com.minecolonies.api.colony does not exist"

**Solution**: Update the Minecolonies version in build.gradle. Check their Maven repository for the exact version:
```gradle
implementation "com.ldtteam:minecolonies:1.21.1-1.1.XXX-snapshot"
```

### Issue: "AbstractInteractionResponseHandler constructor not found"

**Solution**: The Minecolonies API may have changed. Check their source code and update the constructor call in LLMConversationHandler.java.

### Issue: Gradle build fails

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure JDK 21 is installed: `java -version`
2. Update NeoForge Gradle plugin version in build.gradle
3. Clear Gradle cache: `.\gradlew clean`
4. Check internet connection for dependency downloads

### Issue: API calls fail

**Solutions**:
1. Verify API key is correct in config
2. Test API key directly on OpenRouter website
3. Check firewall isn't blocking HTTPS connections
4. Review OpenRouter API status

## üîß Customization Ideas

### Custom Personalities

Edit the system prompt to give citizens different personalities:

```toml
# Grumpy citizen
system_prompt = "You are {name}, a {job} who is often grumpy and short-tempered..."

# Cheerful citizen
system_prompt = "You are {name}, a {job} who is always cheerful and optimistic..."

# Wise elder
system_prompt = "You are {name}, a wise elderly {job} who speaks in riddles..."
```

### Different AI Models

Try different models for varied experiences:

```toml
# Fast and cheap (default)
model = "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"

# Better quality
model = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

# Free option
model = "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"

# Creative responses
model = "anthropic/claude-3-opus"
```

### Adjust Response Length

```toml
# Short responses (faster, cheaper)
max_tokens = 75

# Medium responses (default)
max_tokens = 150

# Long responses (slower, more expensive)
max_tokens = 300
```
